Mine Sweeper:
The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath and cover all the mines with a flag by right clicking.

Hint (lamp):
When a cell (unrevealed) is clicked, the cell and its neighbors are revealed for a second.

Safe Click:
Clicking the Safe-Click button will mark a random covered cell (for a few seconds) that is safe to click.

Mega Hint:
Works only once every game. 
It is used to reveal an area on the board for 2 seconds. 
Functionality description: 
(1) Click the “Mega Hint” button 
(2) then click the area’s top-left cell 
(3) then click bottom-right cell. The whole area will be revealed for 2 seconds.

Exterminator:
Clicking the “Exterminator” button, eliminate 3 of the existing mines randomly. 
These mines will disappear from the board.
